/*
Start traversing the tree from the root node.
If the current node itself is one of p or q, we would mark a variable mid as True and continue the search for the other node in the left and right branches.
If either of the left or the right branch returns True, this means one of the two nodes was found below.
If at any point in the traversal, any two of the three flags left, right or mid become True, this means we have found the lowest common ancestor for the nodes p and q.
